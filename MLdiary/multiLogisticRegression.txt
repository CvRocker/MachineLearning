Multi-logistic regression:

this also calld one-versus-all/one-versus-rest.

procedure:
Train a logistic regression classifier h_i_(x) for each class i to predict the probability that y = i.
(When this step is completed, we will get i number classifiers)
Finally, to make a prediction. When given	a new input x,to run all classifiers and pick the class i that
maximizes the all clssifiers!
