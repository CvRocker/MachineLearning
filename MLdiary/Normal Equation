When should you use Normal Equation and the intuition about what the method does:

theta = (X'X)-1X'y

Normal Equation is a alternative of gradient descent for linear regression.

using normal equation to compute the optima, the Feature scaling is not necessary 

When should you use Normal Equation or Gradient Descent:
Suppose we have om training examples, n features.

Disadvantage:
Gradient Descent:
Need to choose alpha; Needs many iterations.

Normal Equation:
Need to compute (X'X)-1, because computing the inverse matrix is cube time, it's very time comsuming!!
Slow if n is large

Advantage:
Gradient Descent:
Works well even when n is large.
Normal Equation:
No need to choose alpha
Don't need to iterate.

Summary:
if the features n is too large, the Gradient Descent maybe a good choice, and if n is small such as 100, 1000, 10000 and so on, the Normal Equation can compute very faster!


Additional:
What if X'X is non-invertible?
the most common causes is the following two:
1.Redundant features(linearly dependent).
2.Too many features(e.g. m <= n).

delete some features, or use regularization.
